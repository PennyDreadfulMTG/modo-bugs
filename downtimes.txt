After Murders at Karlov Manor was released last week, we discovered an underlying issue that could only be cured by a downtime. Therefore, we will go into scheduled maintenance tomorrow at 9 a.m. Pacific time (17:00 UTC). Our expected return time is 12 p.m. PT (20:00 UTC). During this period our Help and Forums pages will be inaccessible.
